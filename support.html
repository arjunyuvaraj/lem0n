        <h2>Privacy Policy for Basket</h2>
        <p><strong>Effective Date:</strong> September 1st, 2025</p>
        <p>
            Basket is a private app developed and maintained by a single developer,
            <strong>Arjun Yuvaraj</strong>. This privacy policy outlines how your
            data is handled when you use the app.
        </p>

        <h3>1. Data Collection</h3>
        <p>Basket does not collect any personally identifiable information (PII) without your knowledge or consent.</p>
        <p>Depending on how you use the app, it may store the following types of data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Items you manually enter (e.g., grocery lists, shopping details)</li>
            <li>Preferences such as theme settings (e.g., dark mode)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            This data is only stored locally on your device or, if connected to Firebase
            or other services, securely associated with your authenticated account.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Third-Party Services</h3>
        <p>Basket may use trusted third-party services such as:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Firebase Authentication: to sign in and manage your user account</li>
            <li>Firebase Firestore: to store your lists or app data securely in the cloud</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            These services have their own privacy policies which you can review:
            <a href="https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy" target="_blank">Firebase Privacy Policy</a>
        </p>
        <p>No data is shared with third parties for advertising, marketing, or analytics purposes.</p>

        <h3>3. Data Security</h3>
        <p>We take your privacy seriously. All data is either:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Stored securely on your device, or</li>
            <li>Stored in your own Firebase-authenticated user space.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Basket does not have access to your private data beyond what is required for basic app functionality.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you have any questions or concerns about this privacy policy, you can contact the developer directly:
